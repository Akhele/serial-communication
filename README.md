# Serial Communication Flutter App

A Flutter application for communicating with USB serial devices. This app allows you to connect to USB serial devices, send and receive data, and manage connection settings.

## üåê Offline LoRa Communication

**This app + LoRa board = Complete offline messaging solution!**

When combined with a LoRa-enabled board (like the Heltec Wireless Stick Lite V3), this app creates a complete standalone communication system that works **without any cellular network, WiFi, Bluetooth, or internet connection**. The system uses **Long Range (LoRa) radio technology** to enable device-to-device communication over distances of several kilometers, completely independent of traditional network infrastructure.

### Why use this system?
- ‚úÖ **No network required**: Works in remote areas with no cellular or WiFi coverage
- ‚úÖ **No external apps needed**: Direct device-to-device communication
- ‚úÖ **Long range**: LoRa can reach several kilometers depending on terrain
- ‚úÖ **Low power**: Ideal for battery-powered deployments
- ‚úÖ **Privacy**: All communication stays on your local LoRa network
- ‚úÖ **Emergency communication**: Perfect for situations where other networks fail

The Arduino code included (`HeltecV3_SerialBridge.ino`) enables your LoRa board to bridge USB serial communication from your mobile device to the LoRa network, allowing you to chat with other users on the same LoRa network.

## Features

- **Device Discovery**: Automatically detect available USB serial devices
- **Connection Management**: Connect/disconnect to/from devices with configurable baud rates
- **Data Communication**: Send and receive text data in real-time
- **LoRa Bridge Integration**: Connect to LoRa boards for offline long-range communication
- **User Profiles**: Customizable user profiles with personalized settings
- **Message History**: View and export complete conversation history
- **Modern UI**: Clean, Material Design 3 interface with real-time status updates
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / Xcode for platform-specific development
- USB serial device for testing
- **For LoRa communication**: Heltec Wireless Stick Lite V3 (or compatible LoRa board) and Arduino IDE

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd serial-communication
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform Setup

#### Android
- The app requires USB permissions which are already configured in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Connect your USB device via USB OTG adapter
- Grant USB permissions when prompted

#### iOS
- iOS has limited USB serial support
- Consider using Bluetooth or WiFi-based communication for iOS devices
- The app structure supports iOS but may need additional configuration for specific use cases

## Usage

### Basic Serial Communication
1. **Connect Device**: Connect your USB serial device to your mobile device
2. **Select Device**: Choose your device from the dropdown list
3. **Configure Settings**: Adjust baud rate if needed (default: 9600)
4. **Connect**: Tap the "Connect" button to establish communication
5. **Send Data**: Type messages in the input field and tap "Send"
6. **View Messages**: All sent and received messages appear in the messages area

### LoRa Communication Setup
1. **Setup LoRa Board**: Flash the included `HeltecV3_SerialBridge.ino` to your LoRa board (Heltec V3)
2. **Connect Board**: Connect your LoRa board to your mobile device via USB
3. **Open App**: Launch the Serial Communication app
4. **Connect to Board**: Select your LoRa board from the device list
5. **Configure Profile**: Set your username and preferences in the Profile tab
6. **Start Chatting**: Messages you send will be transmitted via LoRa to other connected devices on the same frequency

**Note**: Multiple users on the same LoRa network (same frequency, spreading factor, and bandwidth) can communicate with each other without any additional infrastructure.

### Arduino LoRa Bridge
The `HeltecV3_SerialBridge.ino` sketch provides a bidirectional USB-to-LoRa bridge:
- Receives messages from the Flutter app via USB Serial
- Transmits messages to other LoRa devices on the same network
- Listens for incoming LoRa packets and forwards them to the app
- No external dependencies required (uses built-in LoRaWAN_APP library)

## Dependencies

- `usb_serial`: For USB serial communication
- `permission_handler`: For handling USB permissions
- `flutter`: Flutter SDK

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Detected
- Ensure USB OTG adapter is properly connected
- Check if device drivers are installed
- Try refreshing the device list

### Connection Failed
- Verify the device is not in use by another application
- Check if the correct baud rate is selected
- Ensure USB permissions are granted

### No Data Received
- Verify the device is sending data
- Check baud rate configuration
- Ensure proper cable connection
